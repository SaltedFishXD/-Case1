PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS :
LEFT ROTATOR CUFF TEAR .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 52-year-old right handed male with a many year history of bilateral shoulder pain , right greater than left .
He has steroid injections in the right and in the left four times .
Arthrogram in the distant past showed a right rotator cuff tear and he now has increased pain in his left shoulder .
MRI by report showed bilateral rotator cuff repairs and he was admitted for repair of the left rotator cuff .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Back pain .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Ankle surgery times two on the right .
Pilonidal cyst removal .
MEDICATIONS :
On admission included Naprosyn .
ALLERGIES :
NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES .
HABITS :
The patient smokes two packs per day and has an approximately a 75-pack-year history of smoking .
He has a history of drinking which he discontinued in May .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission revealed a white male with no palpable adenopathy .
HEENT exam was within normal limits .
Lungs revealed occasional wheezing bilaterally at both bases .
Heart was regular with a I / VI systolic ejection murmur without jugular venous distention .
Pulses were 2+ bilaterally .
Abdomen was obese with positive bowel sounds , nontender , nondistended .
Examination of his shoulder revealed the patient to be able to flex his right arm to 170 degrees , internally rotate to 10 degrees and externally rotate to 40 degrees with positive joint tenderness .
All range of motion with his right shoulder was painful .
The left shoulder was identical in range of motion and was also painful .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with the assessment of left rotator cuff repair and he was taken to the Operating Room on the day of admission where he underwent left rotator cuff repair under general endotracheal tube anesthesia .
There were no intraoperative complications .
His postoperative course was generally unremarkable except for a prolonged course of advancement with range of motion of his left shoulder .
Occupational therapy became involved initially and he remained on patient controlled analgesia secondary to problems with left shoulder pain .
He was kept in the hospital for an extended period to improve his postoperative range of motion .
However , he was eventually able to achieve forward flexion of 135 degrees and external rotation of 30 degrees by postoperative day number eight .
His wound remained clean and dry and showed no signs of infection and healed well .
However , his course was otherwise complicated by discovery of persistently elevated blood sugars and Endocrinology was consulted to rule out possible newly diagnosed diabetes .
His hemoglobin A1C levels actually came back within normal limits , however , the wide excursions of his sugars were consistent with possible diabetes .
He was placed on a diabetic diet and his sugars did show some improvement .
It was not necessary to start him on oral hypoglycemics or insulin .
He also complained of occasional spells and jitteriness and some orthostatic dizziness and thus Neurology was consulted and EMG 's were performed which were normal .
His neurologist was contacted , Dr. Cap , and the exact of his problems was not demonstrated during this hospitalization , however , they felt that this could possibly be an autonomic type neuropathy maybe secondary to some underlying diabetic process .
Further work-up of his neurologic conditions were planned as an outpatient .
Thus , he was discharged on postoperative day number eight in good condition with a well healed left shoulder wound and doing well with occupational therapy with plans for him to follow-up with Dr. Necessary .

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE :
CC :
Atypical CP 54 yo smoker , hx of hyperlipidemia , htn , DM , TAH / BSO age 48 , and hx of atypical cp .
She presented in 1999 and stress-ECHO , she exercised 9.5 min without pain , ECHO was nl with no wall motional abn , but EKG showed 1mm ST depressions .
In 2001 , she again p / w CP and ETT again showed 1mm ST depression , exercised 9min .
On 5/23/03 , pt p / w worsening R leg " heat " x 2 days , no difficulty ambulating , min pain .
While waiting for LENI 's in ED , she developed CP , similar to old pain , in low sub-sternal area radiating to left shoulder , no EKG changes .
An ETT was done--pt exercised 9.5 min and there was 2mm ST depression inferiorly and laterally where persisted for 10 minutes during rest .
Enzymes flat .
*** Initial Plan *** ***
CV isch :
Pt has sig risk factors for CAD .
But given no symptoms during exercise x 9.5 min and neg enzymes after exercise , CP is likely not CAD .
However , she is still at high risk for CAD .
Will plan for Cath on 5/24 .
Cont ASA , Lopressor , Zocor .
*** Vasc :
LENI 's to rule out DVT of R leg
*** Endo :
CZI sliding scale .
*** Hosp course ***
Enzymes were flat x3 and pt was ruled out for MI .
A cardiac catheterization was performed which showed clean coronary arteries .
Therefore , she pain was not cardiac .
It is important to note in the future that she physiologically develops 1-2 mm ST depressions during ETT and she reports no pain during ETT .
She should have Stress MIBI or Stress ECHO if there is suspicion of CAD in to future .
Lower extremitiy non-invasives were performed for the R leg " heat " which were negative .
She is discharged on 5/25 .
